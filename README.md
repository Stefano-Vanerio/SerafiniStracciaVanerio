# CLup - Software Engineering II Project - a.y. 2020-2021
# Structure of this Repository
This repository contains all the files that we created to realize the final documents for the project, including all the pictures classified by section. 
The folders that you can find are:

•	RASD: contains all the files used to realize the final pdf (rasd)

•	DD: contains all the files used to realize the final pdf (dd)

•	Presentation: contains all the files used to realize the final pdf (presentation)

# Online collaborative work platform
In the creation of the files related to the project we have used an online collaborative work platform.
In it is possible to see the complete history of all the modifications of the files.

•	At this link is present the file used for the creation of the RASD file: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EinVh5w7yB-jk7-YYJO_MIyqoS4mnwvOs2p9OUenkZg/edit?usp=sharing

•	At this link is present the file used for the creation of the DD file: 

# Project goal and approach

The objective of this project is to apply in practice what you learn during lectures with the purpose of becoming familiar with software engineering practices and able to address new software engineering issues in a rigorous way. The project includes two assignments:

1.	The preparation of a Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD) for the problem provided

2.	The definition of the Design Document (DD) for the system considered in point 1 


# The problem: CLup
•	The aim of the system is to ensure the distance between people and to develop an easy-to-use application that, on the one side, allows store managers to regulate the influx of people in the building and, on the other side, saves people from having to line up and stand outside of stores for hours on end. 

•	Basic Service: 
Lining up service, CLup allows users to “line up” from their home and to retrieve an online ticket without going in front of the store and raising the possibility of creating crowds. The provided ticket has an estimation of the waiting time necessary to enter the store, so the customer can get an idea on when going to the supermarket.
 
•	Advanced function 1:
“Book a visit” service: the application gives the opportunity to make a store visit reservation by inserting the date, time, and expected duration of the visit and by selecting a list of items they would like to buy. Moreover, the system stores reservation data to infer the duration time of the visit for long-term customers. This would allow the application to plan visits in a better way, for example allowing more people in the store, if it knows that they are going to buy different things, hence they will occupy different spaces in the store when they visit.

•	Advanced function 2:
In addition, the application suggests alternatives and options feature: the application must suggest to the customers' alternatives slots in a day/time range for visiting the store, to balance out the number of people in the store, or different stores of the same chain if the preferred one is not available.
The documents realized are based on the basic service and the two-advantage functionality.
